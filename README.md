# WakeUpLight
A simple NodeMCU based design that wakes you up in the most gentle manner.

Note: You probably need to change the folder name to WakeUpLight, but if you won't do it Arduino IDE will probably generate the folder by itself.

#### Pinout:
| NodeMCU pin   | Where you connect it |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| D1  | PIR output  |
| D2  | Controls the LED  |
| 3V3 | PIR VCC |
| GND | PIR GND |
| VIN | 5V Supply |
| GND | Supply GND |
